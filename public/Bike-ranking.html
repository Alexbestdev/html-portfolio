<h1>The best Motocross bikes according to Walter</h1>
<h2>The top 3 Motocross bikes I would buy</h2>
<hr />
<hr />
<h3>2024 Yamaha YZF450F</h3>
<p>
  (My Favourite).With its Kayaba SSS suspension, incredible dependability and
  amazingly broad powerband, the 2024 YZ450F may not be updated, but itâ€™s good
  as it sits.
</p>
<h3>2024 Suzuki RM-Z450</h3>
<p>
  Price. Suzuki raised the price of the 2024 RM-Z450 from $8,999 to $9,199. It
  is still the cheapest 450cc motocross bike on the showroom floor, but jumping
  from the $8,000 price range into the $9,000 range is bad marketing
</p>
<h3>Ducatti Desmo 450 MX</h3>
<p>
  We don't have much technical data on the bikes yet, but here's a look from
  this morning's event!
